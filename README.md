A collection of toy Android Apps I have been coding for fun:

- Morse Code Vibrate - Type in a message, and the pone will vibrate the corresponding morse code.

- HelloAndroid - Currently a mix-match of functionality that uses various location gathering features, and displays/logs the results.

- OpenGL ES Test - Draws a sphere using OpenGL ES
